How to Learn Mobile Development
It‚Äôs a safe bet that you use applications on your smartphone every day. From messaging, language-learning, and calorie-tracking to banking and investing, it seems like there‚Äôs an app for everything. With the growing ubiquity of apps, mobile development has become more relevant than ever.
If you‚Äôd like to know more about mobile application development, Career Karma has you covered. In this guide, we‚Äôve provided everything you'll need to decide whether a career in the field is for you. Also included are resources on the salaries, specializations, and training programs for you to consider.</h4>

It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like, although it may not be that simple. Mobile application development is the process of writing software for mobile devices. It's a unique endeavor in that it gives the developer the chance to build an application from scratch in a relatively short period.
Developers hone their skills based on the operating system they're working on. For this, there really are only two players in town: Google‚Äôs Android OS and Apple‚Äôs iOS. While other smartphones and mobile devices with apps exist, they make up a small fraction of the total market.
<br/><br/>
Developers may learn to work with one operating system and move on to the other as they progress in their careers. Being able to work with both operating systems would make you more competitive in the mobile app developer job market.

With help from a bootcamp, you could be a mobile app developer in 12 months.
<br/><br/>
Why Is Mobile Development Important?<br/>
It may not seem like a big deal but, at the end of the day, mobile app developers do extremely important work. Without a mobile application, many businesses would fail to reach their full potential. This is especially the case with businesses that get much more traffic on their mobile app than on their website.
Mobile apps can be installed onto a phone, can send notifications to users, and are native to the device. It‚Äôs the job of the mobile app developer to ensure mobile apps work correctly so the company can achieve its goals.
<br/><br/>
What Do Mobile App Developers Do?<br/>
A mobile app developer designs, creates, and updates mobile applications, whether on Android or iOS. He or she works with a user experience (UX) designer to make sure their design is aligned with the needs of the user. Together, they create mockups for the app. The developer must also coordinate with business leaders regarding launch strategies.
<br/><br/><br/>
Types of Mobile App Developers
<br/><br/>
There are two main types of mobile app developers: iOS developer and Android developer.
<br/>
iOS Developer
<br/>
iOS developers build, test, and update applications for iOS-powered devices. They use technologies such as Xcode, a development environment, and Swift , the primary iOS programming language, to build applications. iOS developers design applications for iOS devices from the ground up.

<br/><br/>
Android Developer<br/>
Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world. Developers for Android are responsible for developing applications for Android-powered devices. They then test code for edge cases and general usability.
<br/><br/>
Mobile development careers can offer attractive salaries and lucrative job prospects. But becoming a mobile app developer is complicated. Don‚Äôt worry, Career Karma is here to help.
<br/><br/>

How to Learn Mobile Development: Step-by-Step<br/><br/>
The technology sector is constantly growing and evolving. When launching your career in mobile development, there are a lot of potential entry points. In this section, we'll show you how you can easily go from rookie to pro.
<br/><br/>
Step 1: Choose a learning path.<br/>
There‚Äôs more than one way to learn about mobile development. Some mobile app developers attend a college or university and earn a bachelor's degree in computer science. Others are self-taught and have no formal education in computing. Then, there's the other growing alternative: attending a coding bootcamp.

A coding bootcamp typically lasts between three and nine months. During the program, students learn all the skills they need to launch a career in tech. They also build a portfolio of projects which allows them to showcase their skills to prospective employers.

<br/><br/>
Step 2: Choose a platform to focus on.<br/>
So, Android or iOS? As mentioned, it‚Äôs possible to choose one and later transition to the other. It‚Äôs also true that neither is much harder to learn than the other.

In terms of reach, Android has the largest global market share. Android and iOS have similar US market shares. However, iOS tends to be an attractive choice for early adopters and technology enthusiasts. It's also a good choice if you want to heavily monetize your app via in-app purchases.

The main difference between Android and iOS is that they use different programming languages. Android coding is mostly done in Java, and iOS development is mostly done in either Objective-C or Swift. If you have experience in Java, Android might be a good place to start. If you‚Äôve coded in C#, C++, or any of the C languages, you‚Äôll probably find the iOS learning curve less steep.

<br/><br/>
Step 3: Hone and refine your technical skills.<br/>
There are several key skills you‚Äôll need to develop and master to become a successful mobile app developer. We‚Äôll start with iOS developers.

<br/><br/>
Essential Technical Skills for iOS Developers<br/>
These skills include programming languages, development tools, and other programming concepts.
<br/>
Swift:<br/>
Swift is the main programming language used for iOS development. This is a modern programming language that is easy to learn and receives frequent updates. A successful iOS developer should have a good understanding of Swift and its core concepts.
<br/>
UIKit:<br/>
UIKit is a framework that helps iOS developers design their user interfaces. UIKit includes features to implement gestures, animations, default components, and haptic touch control into applications.
<br/>
Xcode:<br/>
Xcode is an application developed by Apple to make it easy to write applications for any Apple device. As an iOS developer, you should be able to navigate your way through Xcode and understand the various features in the tool.
<br/><br/>
Essential Technical Skills for Android Developers<br/>
Now that we've got that covered, let's move on to Android. The following are a few skills Android developers should have to be successful.
<br/><br/>
Building user interfaces:<br/>
You should be able to convert a design into a functional Android application using Java and XML. To do this, you‚Äôll need to know how to use all conventional view containers. You should also know all the standard views and other components that may come up in an Android app.
<br/>
Data storage and notifications:
<br/>
You should know how to store, update, and delete information on an Android device. Even if you rely on outside APIs for an app, you‚Äôll still need to store information locally, on the user‚Äôs device. Further, you should be able to implement push notifications to reach users.
<br/>
Material Design guidelines:

<br/>Many Android apps use the Material Design framework which was created by Google in 2014. You should know how this works in designing and developing new apps. You should also be familiar with the implementation of basic Material Design guidelines into an application.
Step 4: Develop your soft skills.
To be a successful mobile app developer, you‚Äôll need to have a set of ‚Äúsoft‚Äù skills. These include the following:
<br/>
Problem-solving:
All coding jobs require a great element of problem-solving and analytical thinking. This entails thinking through a problem effectively and figuring out a solution using code. You should be capable of fixing problems in existing code. In the same vein, you must know how to make changes to an application to meet new specifications.
Attention to detail:
Details matter in coding. Each detail will affect the output of a program. One typo could cause an application to crash or malfunction. You should spend time looking through every detail when coding.
<br/><br/>
Teamwork:<br/>
As a mobile app developer, you‚Äôll most likely have to work in teams. You should be able to respond well in collaborative environments. More than that, you're going to have to work well with others to accomplish a certain task.
